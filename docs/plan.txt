Planning Steps
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. What will the app do?
    - Scenario
    - User Stories
2. What features will it have?
3. What technologies will I use to build the app?
4. What will the app look like?


- Scenario
    I open the Piffles web app on my laptop. I 
    am already logged in, so I see my library of
    tests. I want to make a new test, so I click
    the "New Test" button. A popup appears, asking
    to upload some notes. I drag and drop a PDF
    of my CMPUT 301 notes on Software Processes 
    into the upload box. A title is made 
    automatically, "Software Processes".
    I edit the title to be "CMPUT 301: Ch. 5: 
    Software Processes", and I add a description
    that says "Notes from Ch. 5 of CMPUT 301". I 
    click the "Make Test" button. A popup opens, 
    asking if I want to do an individual test or a
    group competition. I click "Individual Test". 
    I see a list of 10 questions, each with 4
    choices (a, b, c, d). After I finish the test,
    I click "Done!". I see my new score, new time
    taken, and my old best score and time taken. I
    also see all the questions and answers, both 
    my answer and the correct answer being indicated.
    I didn't realize my friend was watching until he
    shouts, "LET ME PLAY TOO!". I click "exit" and I
    am back to my library. I click on the "CMPUT 301:
    Ch. 5: Software Processes" test, and this time I
    click "Group Competition". A new page w/ a 
    number code and a qr code appears. I pull out my
    phone and scan the qr code w/ my camera. I am now
    in the game, along with my friend. I click start 
    on the laptop and the game begins. After every
    question, I see my friend's answer and my answer, 
    as well as our place in the leaderboard. Since 
    I am a better test taker, I WIN!

AI* For Question and Answers Making
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Convert PDF/PPT to text. If a picture of notes, 
   use OCR(?) to convert to text. --> (Notes pics is extra)
2. Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to find concepts
   and links between concepts, leading to the key ideas from
   the notes.
   - spaCy
   - NLTK
3. Make a database/knowledge graph of concepts and links
   between concepts.
   - Neo4j (for graph database)
   - MongoDB
4. Use the database to make questions and answers using a
   rule-based/template-based system.
   - Python
