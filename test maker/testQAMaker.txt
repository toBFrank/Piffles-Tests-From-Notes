It is a common belief that swans mate for life and that they can be homosexual, forming same-sex pair bonds. While it is true that swans are known for their strong pair bonds, the idea that they mate exclusively with one partner for their entire lives is not entirely accurate. Swans can and do form new pair bonds after losing a mate, and they may also have multiple partners over the course of their lives. However, it is also true that swans have been observed forming same-sex pair bonds, which can be lifelong and involve behaviors such as mutual preening and vocalizations. This phenomenon has been documented in various species of swans, including the iconic mute swan, and is believed to be a natural expression of their social behavior. While there is still much to be learned about swans and their mating habits, their ability to form close bonds with both same and opposite sex partners is a fascinating aspect of their biology.
